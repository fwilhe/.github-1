# Open Component Model Community

Welcome to the Open Component Model community!

This repository outlines all the necessary steps to get started with learning about, using, and contributing to the OCM projects.

## What is the Open Component Model?

The Open Component Model provides a standard for describing delivery artefacts that can be accessed from many types of component repositories.

The following projects form this set of solutions (and more are in the works):
- [OCM Specifications](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/tree/main/doc/specification) - The `ocm-spec` repository contains semantic, formatting, and other types of specifications for OCM.
- [OCM Library](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm#ocm-library) - The OCM Go library contains an API for interacting with the Open Component Model (OCM) elements and mechanisms. A usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/tree/main/examples/lib).
- [OCM CLI](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm#ocm-cli) - The `ocm` CLI may also be used to interact with OCM mechanisms. It makes it easy to create component versions and embed them in build processes. Examples can be found in [this Makefile](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/examples/make/Makefile).

Here are some suggested starting points:
- Read about the [problem statement](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/tree/main/doc/introduction) that the OCM set of solutions can help to solve.
- Start with the documentation about Model Elements [here](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/tree/main/doc/specification/elements).
- Check out this [demo](https://github.com/open-component-model/demo) that integrates with [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) as a CD solution.
